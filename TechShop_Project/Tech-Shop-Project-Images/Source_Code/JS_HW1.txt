1.) In JavaScript, how many data types are there?

Ans: In JavaScript, there are 2 data types available.
a)Primitive data types which include Number , String , Boolean , Null and Undefined.
b)Non Primitive which includes Arrays,Object and Functions.

2.) What kind of numbers are represented by the number type in JavaScript?

Ans: In JavaScript, the number type represents both integer and floating-point values using the double precision floating -point format, which means that all the numbers ,whether they are integer or fractional parts , are teated as 'number' type only.

3.) What is the limitation of the number data type?

Ans:The main limitation of JavaScript'number' type are:
a)It has Precision Issue.
b)It has a range limitation as well and number outside its range loses the precision.
c)No Separate Integer Type causes inaccuracy .

4.) What are the two possible values of the Boolean data type?

Ans:The two posible values in Boolean Data type are:
a)True
b)False

5.) What does the undefined data type represent in JavaScript?

Ans:The undefined data type represents a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value.

6.) What are the primitive data types in JavaScript?

Ans:The primitive data types in JavaScript are:

String: Represents a sequence of characters (eg-"hellojee").
Number: Represents both integers and floating-point numbers (eg- 24, 3.14).
Boolean: Represents a logical value (true/false).
Undefined: Indicates a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

7.) What is the difference between a primitive data type and an object data type in JavaScript?

Ans:Primitive data types are inbuild datatypes representing simple , single value with immutable and direct storage , 
                                         while
	Object represents complex, mutable DS stored as references.
	
8.) What does the NULL data type represent in JavaScript?

Ans:Null data type signifies that a variable has been explicitly set to have no value or to indicate that an object reference is empty or non-existent.

9.) What is the difference between let, var, and const in JavaScript?

Ans:In JS all 3 are used to declare variable only .
But,
Var is globally scoped 
Let is locally accessible within those nearest  declared block
Const cannot be assigned a new value 

Also 
VAR can be :   | LET can be                   | CONST can be 
1:Declared     | 1:Declared                   | 1:Declared
2:Re Declared  | 2:But Cannot Re Declared     | 2:But Cannot be Re Declared
3:Assign       | 3:Assign                     | 3:Assigned
4:Re Assign    | 4:Re Assign                  | 4:But Cannot be Re Assign

10.) How to declare multiple Variables in JavaScript?

Ans:We can use Var Keyword to declare multiple variables at once , separated by commas.
Eg, var x=2,y=3,z=4,p=7,q=8,r=9;
